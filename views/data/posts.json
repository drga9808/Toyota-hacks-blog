    "content": "Original Toyota parts are specifically designed to fit and function perfectly in your vehicle. They meet Toyotaâ€™s rigorous quality standards and ensure long-term reliability and performance.\r\n\r\nWhile many people associate OEM parts with expensive dealership visits, there are trustworthy online options that source directly from dealerships. These include:\r\n\r\n- [parts.toyota.com](https://parts.toyota.com)\r\n- [parts.lexus.com](https://parts.lexus.com)\r\n- [Olathe Toyota Parts Center](https://parts.olathetoyota.com) â€” a dealership in the U.S. offering nationwide shipping.\r\n\r\n### Understanding Toyota Part Numbers\r\n\r\nToyota part numbers follow a specific format that reveals useful information:\r\n\r\n- **12345**-12345: Standard format. The first five digits (PNC) are the Part Number Code, shared across various models.\r\n- 12345-12345-**B3**: The suffix (like B3) may indicate color or trim variation.\r\n- 12345-12345-**84**: The suffix (84) indicates a remanufactured part, certified by Toyota â€” often a more affordable and still reliable option.\r\n\r\n### Special Service Kits\r\n\r\nParts beginning with **0400*-***** ** refer to full repair kits. These kits often include everything needed for a specific repair, making them more cost-effective and complete than ordering each part individually.\r\n\r\n### Other Toyota Part Variants\r\n\r\n- **12345-WA123**: BW-type parts.\r\n- **12345-AZ123**: Economical parts designed to compete with aftermarket offerings.\r\n- **SU123-12345**: Subaru parts supplied through Toyota's system.\r\n- **12345-WB123**: Mazda parts.\r\n- **G1234-12345**: Hybrid system components.\r\n- **YZZ**: Often found in maintenance parts such as filters or fluids.\r\n\r\n### Important Reminder\r\n\r\nYou can only buy a true Toyota original part from a dealership. Even if you buy online, the seller should clearly state which dealership supplies the part. This ensures you're not getting counterfeit or inferior aftermarket components labeled as OEM.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to maintaining your vehicle's performance, safety, and value, sticking "

    "description": "Toyota Power Steering problems explained: when to replace parts and why leaks arenâ€™t always urgent.",
    "content": "Toyota vehicles use power steering systems designed for long-term performance and driver comfort. Depending on the model and year, these systems can be hydraulic or electric. Here's what you need to know, especially if you're maintaining or troubleshooting an older Toyota like the RAV4.\r\n\r\n### Hydraulic Power Steering System\r\n\r\nHydraulic systems use pressurized fluid to assist with steering. The main components include:\r\n\r\n1. **Power Steering Reservoir:** Stores the fluid and connects to two hoses:\r\n   - **Pressure Line:** Sends fluid to the power steering pump.\r\n   - **Return Line:** Returns fluid from the rack and pinion.\r\n2. **Power Steering Pump:** Pressurizes the fluid and delivers it to the rack and pinion for steering assist.\r\n3. **Rack and Pinion:** Directs the pressurized fluid to help move the wheels when you turn the steering wheel. A valve inside directs the flow, and fluid returns to the reservoir through the return line.\r\n\r\n### Common Wear Areas & Maintenance Tips\r\n\r\n#### ðŸ›ž Intermediate Shaft Noise\r\n\r\nThe intermediate shaft can sometimes cause a *clunk-clunk* noise when turning. This is often due to dry joints between the pinion and the steering shaft. Itâ€™s not dangerous â€” just an annoyance.\r\n\r\n#### ðŸ›  Power Steering Pump\r\n\r\nThese are highly durable components in Toyotas and rarely fail under normal driving conditions.\r\n\r\n#### ðŸ§° Rack and Pinion\r\n\r\n- The most frequent issue is torn rubber seals or damaged boots, leading to leaks.\r\n- If seals keep failing after replacement, itâ€™s best to replace the entire rack and pinion assembly. OEM parts are expensive, but quality aftermarket units with warranty are a smart alternative.\r\n- Leaks near the shaft at the back of the rack and pinion are usually **low-pressure leaks** â€” not urgent and can take years to cause real damage.\r\n\r\n#### ðŸª› Power Steering Return Line\r\n\r\nThis line is a known leak point in older models. An aftermarket replacement is generally sufficient and much cheaper than OEM.\r\n\r\n#### ðŸ”© Tie Rod Issue (RAV4 2006â€“2012)\r\n\r\nThe inne"

    "description": "Should you change struts, shocks, or springs on your Toyota? Learn when it's necessary and which parts to avoid.",
    "content": "Your Toyota's suspension system plays a critical role in both comfort and safety. Whether you're dealing with worn struts, noisy mounts, or sagging springs, knowing what to replace â€” and when â€” can save you money and prevent unnecessary repairs.\r\n\r\n### Struts\r\n\r\nStruts are essential for absorbing road impacts and stabilizing your vehicle. But contrary to popular belief, **you only need to replace them when there's a clear problem**.\r\n\r\n- **Leaking Below the Mid Plate:** If fluid is leaking from below the middle section of the strut and you're hearing unusual noises, itâ€™s time for a replacement.\r\n- **Leaking Above the Mid Plate:** A small amount of fluid above the middle plate doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the strut has failed. Monitor it before rushing to replace.\r\n- **Important Tip:** Always use a **new original Toyota nut** when installing a new strut to ensure proper torque and fitment.\r\n\r\n### Shock Absorbers\r\n\r\nShock absorbers reduce bounce and maintain tire contact with the road. Like struts, they should only be replaced when they're actually worn out.\r\n\r\n- If they're leaking **below the halfway point** and causing noise, they should be replaced.\r\n- If the leak is minor and not accompanied by performance issues, monitor them rather than replacing prematurely.\r\n\r\n### Springs\r\n\r\nSprings rarely need replacement unless:\r\n\r\n- They're visibly **cracked or broken**.\r\n- The car sits **noticeably lower** than normal due to old, worn-out springs.\r\n\r\n### Strut Mounts\r\n\r\nStrut mounts are a common source of noise in aging suspensions. Always use **OEM (original)** mounts when replacing them.\r\n\r\n- If the rubber inside the mount is crushed or has come loose, it can cause clunking sounds and should be replaced immediately.\r\n\r\n### Quick Struts vs. OEM Component Replacement\r\n\r\n**Avoid using quick struts** whenever possible. These pre-assembled units often use lower-quality parts and may not match your Toyota's original ride quality.\r\n\r\nThe best approach is to replace only the parts that are actually worn or broken â€” "
