    "content": "<p>Original Toyota parts are specifically designed to fit and function perfectly in your vehicle. They meet Toyota\\u2019s rigorous quality standards and ensure long-term reliability and performance.</p>\\n            <p>While many people associate OEM parts with expensive dealership visits, there are trustworthy online options that source directly from dealerships. These include:</p>\\n            <ul>\\n                <li><a href=\\\"https://parts.toyota.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">parts.toyota.com</a></li>\\n                <li><a href=\\\"https://parts.lexus.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">parts.lexus.com</a></li>\\n                <li><a href=\\\"https://parts.olathetoyota.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Olathe Toyota Parts Center</a> \\u2014 a dealership in the U.S. offering nationwide shipping.</li>\\n            </ul>\\n            <h3>Understanding Toyota Part Numbers</h3>\\n            <p>Toyota part numbers follow a specific format that reveals useful information:</p>\\n            <ul>\\n                <li><strong>12345</strong>-12345: Standard format. The first five digits (PNC) are the Part Number Code, shared across various models.</li>\\n                <li>12345-12345-<strong>B3</strong>: The suffix (like B3) may indicate color or trim variation.</li>\\n                <li>12345-12345-<strong>84</strong>: The suffix (84) indicates a remanufactured part, certified by Toyota \\u2014 often a more affordable and still reliable option.</li>\\n            </ul>\\n            <h3>Important Reminder</h3>\\n            <p>You can only buy a true Toyota original part from a dealership. Even if you buy online, the seller should clearly state which dealership supplies the part. This ensures you're not getting counterfeit or inferior aftermarket components labeled as OEM.</p>\\n            <p>When it comes to maintaining your vehicle's performance, safety, and value, sticking with genuine Toyota parts is always the smart move.</p>"
